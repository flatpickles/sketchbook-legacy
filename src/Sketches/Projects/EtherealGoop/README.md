## [Shader Template](http://flatpickles.com/sketchbook/#shader-template)

This is a template project for a shader-based sketch. This shouldn't be published in its current form, but should instead be duplicated and used as a starting point for new projects.

### Parameters

* `Demo Float`: In the template project, this is mapped to the size of the circle.
* `Demo Color`: In the template project, this is mapped to the color of the circle.
