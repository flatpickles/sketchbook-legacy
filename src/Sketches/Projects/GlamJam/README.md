## [Glam Jam](http://flatpickles.com/sketchbook/#glam-jam)

To Do:

- "Color Cycles" isn't usually too interesting, maybe adapt
- Should "Noise Density" be some sort of "zoom"? Should we have zoom for the backing pattern as well?
- How do we approach customizable color? Maybe creating radial gradients between two or more colors + a center color ...
