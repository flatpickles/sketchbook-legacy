## Notes

Creative notes, usage details, and further considerations for each of the sketches within Sketchbook. These notes may mirror the descriptions & parameter hover-text available via the Sketchbook web app, but may also elaborate further. Notes may not be available the older projects that I've ported into Sketchbook from other environments.
